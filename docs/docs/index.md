# Progature

## Summary
*Progature* is a programming advanture game writen with ``python``. <br>
This project is completely **offline** and can run on your machine. <br>
Main reason why I started this project was that I want to learn something, but I need to see my progress in my learning jurney, this tool lets you create *Games*, each *Game* has one *Skill* to achive and some *Chapters* to complete, these *Chapters* contain number of *Levels* and each *Level* has some *Quests*. <br>
With this structure you can keep your learning data and watch your progress through out your learning jurney, this makes you more **motivated**, **efficient** and **organized** in your learnings.
